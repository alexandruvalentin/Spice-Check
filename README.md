## UX

### __Business Goals__

-	Launch an online recipe book where users can search for culinary recipes and also for meal ideas based on their items already available in the fridge;
-	Create an online presence and build a community of followers;
-	Keep users up to date with new recipes and kitchen tips & tricks;
-	Provide a place where users can submit their recipes and get featured;

### __Customer Goals__

-	Learn about new food recipes;
-	Find meal ideas based on the items available to them;
-	Submit recipes or any query;
-	Access to detailed information about each recipe (calories, diet labels etc);
-	Stay up to date with the brand’s social media accounts;
-	A responsive, professional website; 

### __User Stories__

1.	"As a first-time visitor, I want to navigate through your website quickly and efficiently."
2.	"As a first-time visitor, I want to easily understand the purpose of your website."
3.	“As a first-time visitor, I want to have a broad range of search filters available to choose from.”
4.	"As a returning visitor, I want to follow your social media accounts in order to join the community."
5.	“As a returning visitor, I want to be able to submit queries/recipes via form input.”
6.	"As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to access your website across a range of devices."

### __Scope__

* __Functional requirements:__

    -   Option to easily navigate through the pages and content;
    -  Option to search the web for desired meals/recipes;
    -  Option to view social media accounts;
    -  Option to submit form;

* __Content requirements:__

    -	Compelling content that communicates the purpose of the website;
    -	Content flexibility for easier scanning;
    -	Mixed media content for easy understanding of concepts presented;
    -	Various CTAs;

### __Structure__

 The website is designed to be intuitive and learnable

1.	Interaction design:
-	The interface responds to the user actions as expected. The scroll/swipe functional behaviour is standard and the buttons respond instantly when actioned;
-	Subtle visual feedback will be added throughout the page(on hover, focus and action of buttons and search fields) in order to increase the user's interaction experience;
2.	Information architecture
-	The content is organised in order of importance, from top to bottom and left to right
-	The information is structured in nested lists.
